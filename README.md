# Mountain range results 
This repository holds the gif simulations of the mountain range obstacle avoidance simulation from the CDC paper



### Coordination in mountains problem 

The following gifs show trajectories of the vehicles before and after the training of a distributed neurSLS controller, where the agents that need to coordinate in order to pass through a narrow passage while trying to keep a rectangular shape, starting from a random initial position marked with &#9675;.
